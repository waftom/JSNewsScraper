In order to deploy your project to Heroku, you must set up an mLab provision. mLab is remote MongoDB database that Heroku supports natively. Follow these steps to get it running:

Create a Heroku app in your project directory.

Run this command in your Terminal/Bash window:

heroku addons:create mongolab
This command will add the free mLab provision to your project.
You'll need to find the URI string that connects Mongoose to mLab. Run this command to grab that string:

heroku config | grep MONGODB_URI
Notice the value that appears after MONGODB_URI =>. This is your URI string. Copy it to a document for safekeeping.
When you’re ready to connect Mongoose with your remote database, simply paste the URI string as the lone argument of your mongoose.connect() function. That’s it!
